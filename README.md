# Team SEVen's Weblab Project: Minion Mania

Minion Mania is a fun multiplayer game where players build towers and minions in a battle to destroy the opponent first. Players can create and join public or private lobbies to start the game, create and choose custom maps, and see their rating and rankings on the leaderboard.
